# sanitize_discord
An attempt at making Discord less insufferable.
Made and tested for UBO, but it only uses element property matching, -abp-has(), and -abp-contains() so may work with other engines.

a few of the features:
- Blocked means blocked
- No ads (if interacting with it redirects/popups "buy this", then it is an advertisement by definition)
- Remove distractive, obstructive, or annyoying things (mostly paid decorations, serves previous feature as well)
- Remove redundant UI (functionality still accessible through conventional menu)
- Remove useless UI (i.e. message bar in channels you have no permission to message in)
- Unrounds everything so full png is always visible
